# Anedext
The Anedext text editor is an editor for text.

# State
Currently, it only runs on Linux; compiled initially on Linux 6.18.7 on arch.

# Convention
I try to adhere to the C header file guidelines written by David Kieras for the
university of Michigan; they seem reasonable enough to this day, C's an old
language.
